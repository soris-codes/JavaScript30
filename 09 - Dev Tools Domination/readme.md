# 09 - Dev Tools Domination

## Challenge Notes

* Very cool tips here for using the Dev Tools on Chrome! 
* The different options for warnings, errors, and info could be useful. The different colors on the console output make the warnings/info stand out as opposed to any other output on a regular `console.log` statement. 
* I had not seen the `%c` used before for styled output to the console.
