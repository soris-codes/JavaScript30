# 08 = Fun with HTML Canvas

## Challenge Notes

* So many firsts!
* First time using the `<canvas>` tag in HTML
* First time using hsl for color selection
* So cool to see the end product with the variance in color and line width as you "paint" on the canvas with your mouse.
* Played a bit with adding gradient to some text on an additional `<canvas>` element on the screen
