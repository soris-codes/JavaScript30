# 02 - JS/CSS Clock

## Challenge Notes
  * Learning about several transition and transform properties of CSS. First time using the cubic-bezier option that allowed for the clock hands to have a more realistic bounce/movement when transitioning.
  * PIN - Still need to figure out how to correct the small blip that occurs when the seconds hand moves to 0 seconds.
