# 07 - Array Cardio 2

## Challenge Notes

* This is another challenge in which there is no output to the DOM. Instead you can view the results on the browser console. In Chrome, you can right-click and select "Inspect" and then choose the "Console" tab.
* Learned how to use the array functions of `some()` and `every()`. They run a callback function on every element of the array and return true if some or every element meets the specified condition.
* While I have used `splice()` before to remove items from an array, using the spread operator `...` in combination with `slice()` is new to me.
