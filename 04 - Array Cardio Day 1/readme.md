# 04 - Array Cardio Day 1

# Challenge Notes
  * This was a great review of using the trifecta of array functions - `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. 
  * Attempted this all on my own at first and referenced MDN Web Docs before working through it with the video.
  * `console.table` where have you been all my life?! Really nice way to see the arrays displayed on the console.
  * Using `reduce()` to do frequency count is much sleeker than my for loops of the past.
