# 03- CSS Variables

# Challenge Notes
  * Very cool! To use CSS variables, define your variables in the CSS styles (Wes recommended using the :root pseudo-class) as a custom property (use --) and give them default values. Reference the variables in other selectors and anytime the variables are updated (via Javascript), all the element styles referencing that variable will update accordingly.
 * I could see using CSS variables to create a theme selector utility for testing primary/accent colors and even fonts for an application or website.
