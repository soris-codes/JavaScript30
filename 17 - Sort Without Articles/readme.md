# 17 - Sort Without Articles

## Challenge Notes

* Practice with using regular expressions (regex) to strip the band names of the articles "The", "An", and "A"
* Troubleshooting list item `<li>` entries that had a comma in between. I had to use a `.join('')` command to turn the band list into a single long string in order for it to display properly in the unordered list.
